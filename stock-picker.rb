General Task.  stock_picker method that will take in an array of stock 
prices, one for each hypothetical day.  Have it return a pair of days 
showing the best day to buy and sell.  So buy low and sell high and buy
before you sell.
Ex: stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10]) 
returns [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
