This repository will contanin the caesar cipher project, 

	Caesar Cipher: Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.

	You will need to remember how to convert a string into a number.
		Using .ord to convert to ASCII value and .chr to convert back to 
		a string.  letter.ord gives the ascii value and letter.chr back to letter.
    Don't forget to wrap from z to a.
    Don't forget to keep the same case.
    Also remember to leave exclamation characters alone.
